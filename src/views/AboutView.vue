            I have had the opportunity to work with clients from various
            industries, including e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. My

            well as experience with frameworks such as Vuejs, Shopify and
            Hydrogen. In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong
            communicator and enjoy collaborating with clients to understand
            their unique needs and goals.
